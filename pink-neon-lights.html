        <p ><sub>1</sub>Everytime I think of you and when we were happy together,<br>
        <sub>2</sub>I see myself walking down a short dim corridor, then<br>
        <sub>3</sub>into the room I find myself longing to be in again the most -<br>
        <sub>4</sub>in it with you and I in bed, and kissing under the pink neon lights.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="stanza" tabindex="0">
        <p><sub>5</sub>I've taken for granted the warm smiles and the even warmer embraces<br>
        <sub>6</sub>that were so plentiful then, now even the thought of them<br>
        <sub>7</sub>sends chills to my nape and shakes me to my core.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="stanza" tabindex="0">
        <p><sub>8</sub>Those were the years squeezed into months and the days stretched to forever.<br>
        <sub>9</sub>Those were sweet memories now with a bittersweet flavor.<br>
        <sub>10</sub>They warm my heart for a moment but a cold flood of regret and realization<br>
        <sub>11</sub>drowns out the warm and chills my blood like cold arctic waters.<br>
        <sub>12</sub>The fear of frostbite compels me to remind myself always of the love I have for you<br>
        <sub>13</sub>and our memories in that heavenly neon pink palace</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="stanza" tabindex="0">
        <p><sub>14</sub>Oh how I wish for the days we bathed in that pink neon haze.<br> <sub>15</sub>I know that I was just too amazed at your love and how you showed it in so many ways<br><sub>16</sub>like when I woke up to you and a hand covered in glaze<br> <sub>16</sub>from the donuts you ordered from that place we loved that wasn't too far away.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="stanza" tabindex="0">
        <p><sub>17</sub>I would be wrong if I said I'm not the reason we lost so many days of happiness and love in that neon pink place.<br>
        <sub>18</sub>I would be lying if I said I didn't care that you're not next to me now<br>
        <sub>19</sub>with that same look in your eyes from my memory of us under pink neon lights.</p>
